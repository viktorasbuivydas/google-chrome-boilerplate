## Simple Toggle Sites

This is a *very* basic Google Chrome extension that lets you toggle between blocking and unblocking a list of website URLs. It was built because I didn't need something super strict, just a helpful tool to prevent me from wasting time when I needed to concentrate.

Plus, I wanted to open source this so you can see the exact inner workings of the extension without having to worry that your browsing privacy is at risk.

Right now this is very much in development, but if you would like to try it out for yourself, follow these steps to install:

1. Clone or download an archive of this repository
2. Navigate in your browser to `chrome://extensions`
3. Make sure that Developer mode is active, using the toggle switch in the top-right
4. Click the **Load Unpacked** button toward the top-left, selecting the `dist` directory in this repo

Once installed, you can use the extension by:

1. Clicking the icon in your extension toolbar
2. Adding your desired websites one per line to the text box
3. Toggling the active state on or off, which will either block or let you load any of the sites in your list
